There is lots of information, I decided to split it into different MarkDown files. Here are links only.<br/>

> *NOTE:* All the code is contained in the MarkDown files because there can't be too many examples in one project.

## CONTENTS:
* [DataTypes][1]
* [Variables][2]
* [Operators][5]
* [Loops][3]
* [Arrays][4]
* [IF-ELSE][6] *(Decision maker)*
* [SWITCH-CASE][7] *(Decision maker)*
