## <p align=center>DataTypes</p>

Java is a statically and strongly typed language because these functions are inherited from C and C ++.

Data Types in Java:

Java has two categories of data: 
 
**Primitive Data Type**: such as *boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double*<br/>
**Non-Primitive Data Type** or **Object Data type**: such as *String, Array and etc.*

1. **boolean:** - data type represents only one bit of information either true or false, but the size of the boolean data type is virtual machine-dependent.
2. **byte:** The byte data type is an 8-bit signed twoâ€™s complement integer. Useful for saving memory in large arrays.
3. **short:** The short data type is a 16-bit signed integer. Useful for saving memory in large arrays such as byte.
